            <h2>Nutrition Tips for a Healthy Lifestyle</h2>
            <p>
              Good nutrition is the foundation of your energy, performance, and overall well-being.
              By making small but consistent improvements in your eating habits, you can boost your health,
              prevent diseases, and feel stronger every day.
            </p>

            <h3>Simple Rules of Balanced Nutrition:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Eat a variety of foods.</strong> Combine vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and
                healthy fats daily.</li>
              <li><strong>Follow the "plate rule".</strong> Half of your plate should be vegetables and fruits, one
                quarter
                protein, and one quarter whole grains.</li>
              <li><strong>Stay hydrated.</strong> Drink at least 2 liters of water daily. Limit sugary drinks and energy
                drinks.</li>
              <li><strong>Don’t skip breakfast.</strong> A balanced breakfast helps maintain concentration and energy
                throughout the day.</li>
              <li><strong>Prefer whole foods.</strong> Choose less processed products: whole bread, brown rice, nuts,
                legumes.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Limit sugar and salt.</strong> Too much sugar contributes to weight gain, while excess salt
                raises
                blood pressure.</li>
              <li><strong>Healthy snacks.</strong> Replace chips and sweets with nuts, yogurt, fruit, or vegetables with
                hummus.</li>
              <li><strong>Plan your meals.</strong> Preparing food at home helps control portions and ingredients.</li>
              <li><strong>Listen to your body.</strong> Eat slowly and stop when you feel full, not when the plate is
                empty.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Moderation, not restriction.</strong> Allow yourself occasional treats — balance is key.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              <strong>Remember</strong>: balanced nutrition is not about strict diets but about sustainable choices
              that give you energy and keep your body healthy in the long term.

            <strong>Tip:</strong> Consistency beats intensity. Even <strong>20 minutes</strong> a day is better than one
            long weekly workout.
